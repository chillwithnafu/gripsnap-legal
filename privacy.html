    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 18, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Gridsnap ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use our mobile application ("the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> Gridsnap does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. Your game data (such as high scores) is stored only on your device. The App displays ads through Google AdMob, which is a third-party service with its own data practices.
    </div>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    <p>Gridsnap does not collect any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
        <li>Account credentials or login information</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
        <li>Any personally identifiable information (PII)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not have user accounts, registration, or login functionality. We do not use any analytics services.</p>

    <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>
    <p>The App stores the following data <strong>locally on your device only</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your high score</li>
        <li>Game settings (such as sound preferences)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device. We cannot access, view, or retrieve this information. If you uninstall the App or clear its data, this information is permanently deleted.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
    <p>Gridsnap displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. Google AdMob is a third-party service operated by Google LLC, and it has its own data collection practices that are independent of our App.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What Google AdMob may collect:</strong></p>
    <p>According to Google's documentation, AdMob may collect certain information to serve and personalize ads, which may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (device type, operating system)</li>
        <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>General location (derived from IP address, not precise GPS)</li>
        <li>Ad interaction data</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> This data collection is performed by Google, not by us. We do not have access to any data collected by AdMob.</p>
    
    <p>For complete information about Google's data practices, please review:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Google Uses Information from Sites or Apps That Use Our Services</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Your Choices Regarding Ads</h3>
    <p>You can control personalized advertising through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
        <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Tracking → Disable "Allow Apps to Request to Track"</li>
        <li><strong>Google Ad Settings:</strong> <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adssettings.google.com</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Gridsnap is a general audience puzzle game. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction).</p>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal information, there is no children's data to delete. However, if you have concerns about ads shown to children, you can use the device-level parental controls and ad personalization settings described above.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or transmit any personal data, there is no personal data at risk. Your local game data (high scores, settings) is stored using your device's standard app data storage.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights under privacy laws such as GDPR, CCPA, or others. However, since we do not collect any personal information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There is no personal data for us to access, correct, or delete</li>
        <li>There is no data for us to port or restrict processing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For any data collected by Google AdMob, please contact Google directly or use the controls described in the "Your Choices Regarding Ads" section above.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy if we change our practices. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
